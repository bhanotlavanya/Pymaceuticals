In this challenge we have been given a data of a Pymaceutical company where different drug has been tested on mouse.
Our challenge is to scrunize the data to find out which drug worked the best to decrease the tumour size.
we are also checking if the study was conducted fairly which include if both sex were included in it or not.
if there are any outliers in the study which effects the overall success rate.
